Allows interaction with a single, specific Xiaomi device:
get its status, send commands, and subscribe to notifications.

### Device Identification

The device can be specified in several ways:

1. **Node Config**: Device parameters are set manually in the node's
    configuration panel.
    - **Discovered Device**: You can select a device from the list
    automatically found by the `Devices` node. This is the easiest method.
    - **Manual**: You can enter the device parameters (ID, IP, MAC, token, model)
    manually. This is useful for devices that are not discovered automatically.
2. **`msg.device`**: The node will use the device object passed in
the incoming `msg.device`.
This allows for dynamic control of different devices with a single node.

**Important: The `Model` Field**

For correct operation, especially with Bluetooth devices, it is **critically important** to specify the correct **Model** (e.g., `deerma.humidifier.jsq2w`).

A correctly specified `Model` allows the node to use a dedicated class for your device. These classes provide convenient, human-readable names for properties (e.g., `fan_level` instead of `siid: 2, piid: 6`) and may also offer additional methods (e.g., `getRooms()` for vacuums).

A full list of implemented device classes, their properties, actions, and methods is available in the `xmihome-devices` package documentation:

- **[List of Supported Device Classes](https://github.com/alex2844/node-xmihome/blob/main/packages/devices/README.md)**

**What if my model is not on the list?**

Don't worry! If a specific class for your model is not found, the library will automatically try to download its official MiOT specification from the cloud. This works for most modern devices. In this case, you will be able to control the device using the standard `siid` and `piid` for properties and `siid` and `aiid` for actions.

### Actions

The node can perform various actions on the device:

- **Get Properties**: Requests *all* readable properties
from the device and returns them as an object.
- **Get Property**: Requests the value of a single, specific property.
The property name is set in the "Property" field or via `msg.property`.
- **Set Property**: Sets the value of a single property.
  - **Property**: The name of the property to change.
  - **Value**: The new value. Can be a string, number, boolean, or JSON object.
- **Call Action**: Calls a specific action on the device (e.g., `start_sweep` for a vacuum).
  - **Property**: The name of the action to call.
  - **Value**: The parameters for the action, typically an array (e.g., `[]`).
- **Call Method**: Calls a method directly on the device's class instance. This is for advanced use cases not covered by standard properties or actions (e.g., `getRooms` or `getMapImage` on a vacuum).
  - **Property**: The name of the method to call.
  - **Value**: The parameters for the method, as an array.
- **Subscribe to Property**: Subscribes to notifications for property changes.
The node will send a message to the **first output** every time the device
reports a new value. The connection to the device will be kept active.
- **Unsubscribe from Property**: Cancels a previously created subscription.

### Inputs

- `msg.device` (object, optional): If set,
overrides the device configuration in the node.
- `msg.property` (string, optional): If set,
overrides the property or action specified in the node.
- `msg.payload` (any): Used as the "Value" for the "Set Property" or "Call Action"
action if the "Value" field in the node is configured to use `msg.payload`.
- `msg.topic` (string, optional): If set, overrides the topic for the outgoing message.

### Outputs

1. **Result / Notifications**
    - For `Get/Set/Call` actions: Sends a single message with the result of the operation.
    `msg.payload` contains the retrieved value, action result,
    or is an object `{property, value}` on a successful set.
    - For `Subscribe`: Sends a message each time a notification is received.
    `msg.payload` contains the new property value.
2. **Connection Events**
    - Sends messages about the device's connection status.
    Useful for debugging and monitoring.
    - `msg.payload.event` can be:
    `connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, `reconnect_failed`, `error`.
    - `msg.topic` will be structured like `connection/...` or `error/...`.
