This is a monorepo for `node-xmihome` â€” a set of tools for controlling
Xiaomi Mi Home devices using Node.js. The project provides both a core
library for developers and a ready-to-use integration for Node-RED.

## Development Setup

To work with this monorepo, you will need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh/),
as it correctly handles the workspace dependencies for this project.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alex2844/node-xmihome.git
    cd node-xmihome
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install dependencies for all packages and create the
    necessary symlinks between them.

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3. **Build packages:**
    If any package requires a build step (e.g., `node-red-contrib-xmihome`),
    you can build all packages at once using:

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

4. **Type checking:**
    To check the code with TypeScript, run:

    ```bash
    bun run test
    ```
