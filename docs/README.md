This is a monorepo for `node-xmihome` â€” a set of tools for controlling
Xiaomi Mi Home devices using Node.js. The project provides both a core
library for developers and a ready-to-use integration for Node-RED.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several packages located in the `packages/` directory:

| Package | NPM | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`xmihome`](../packages/node/) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xmihome.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmihome) | The core library for interacting with Xiaomi devices via Cloud, MiIO, and Bluetooth. |
| [`node-red-contrib-xmihome`](../packages/node-red/) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-red-contrib-xmihome.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-xmihome) | A set of nodes for easy integration of `xmihome` into Node-RED projects. |
| [`xmihome-devices`](../packages/devices/) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xmihome-devices.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmihome-devices) | Definitions and specifications for specific device models. |
| [`xmihome-web`](../packages/web/) | (Private) | A demo web application for controlling devices via Web Bluetooth. |

## Development Setup

To work with this monorepo, you will need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh/),
as it correctly handles the workspace dependencies for this project.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alex2844/node-xmihome.git
    cd node-xmihome
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install dependencies for all packages and create the necessary symlinks between them.

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3. **Build packages:**
    If any package requires a build step (e.g., `node-red-contrib-xmihome`), you can build all packages at once using:

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

4. **Type checking:**
    To check the code with TypeScript, run:

    ```bash
    bun run test
    ```

## Publishing

This project uses a synchronized versioning model.
Publishing is handled by a custom script
that ensures all packages have the same version.

### Publishing Steps

1. **Set the version:**
    Manually update the `version` field in the root
    `package.json` file to the desired new version.

2. **Run the publish script:**
    This command will update the version in all sub-packages to match
    the root `package.json`, and then publish all public packages to the npm registry.

    ```bash
    bun run publish
    ```
